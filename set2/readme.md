TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

This week I learned about values, variables, expressions, functions. collections, flow control and iteration. Out of these topics, I am still unclear about collections, specifically the use of the different brackets. I need more practice using the different brackets for their intended purpose.
